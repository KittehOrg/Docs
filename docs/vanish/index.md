# VanishNoPacket

**VanishNoPacket** allows players to control if they are visible to the rest of the players on the server. 
This is excellent for stalking potential bad users (griefers, hacking if you don't allow it, etc.), 
observing players while they remain unaware of your presence.

What makes **VanishNoPacket** awesome? **VanishNoPacket** tricks players into thinking you're not anywhere nearby,
or not even on the server! Other players are unable to see you, while you can stalk them around the map
watching for griefing or other unscrupulous behavior. 

*A fine choice of invisibility for the discerning server administrator.*
